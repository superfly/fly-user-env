# Critical State Management Test Gaps

## Process Management

### Critical Process State Risks
- No verification of our state tracking after process crash during checkpoint creation
- No verification of our state tracking after process crash during checkpoint restoration
- No verification of our state tracking after process restart during active operations
- No verification of our state tracking when process is killed during checkpoint operations

## State Management

### Critical Checkpoint Risks
- No verification of our checkpoint state tracking when system crashes during checkpoint creation
- No verification of our checkpoint state tracking when system crashes during checkpoint restoration
- No verification of our state tracking when checkpoint restoration fails midway
- No verification of our state tracking when multiple checkpoints are created concurrently
- No verification of our state tracking when checkpoint creation overlaps with active operations

### Critical Component State Risks
- No verification of our state tracking when database manager fails during checkpoint
- No verification of our state tracking when filesystem manager fails during checkpoint
- No verification of our state tracking when multiple components fail simultaneously
- No verification of our state tracking when component recovery fails

## System Integration

### Critical Component Interaction Risks
- No verification of our state tracking when database manager fails during filesystem operation
- No verification of our state tracking when filesystem manager fails during database operation
- No verification of our state tracking when checkpoint fails during active operations
- No verification of our state tracking when multiple components fail simultaneously

### Critical Recovery Risks
- No verification of our state tracking after system crash during active operations
- No verification of our state tracking after system crash during checkpoint
- No verification of our state tracking after system crash during component operations

## Recommended Critical Tests

1. State Tracking Tests
   - Test our state tracking when process crashes during checkpoint creation
   - Test our state tracking when process crashes during checkpoint restoration
   - Test our state tracking when process crashes during component operations
   - Test our state tracking when process crashes during active operations

2. Concurrent Operation Tests
   - Test our state tracking with concurrent checkpoint operations
   - Test our state tracking with concurrent component operations
   - Test our state tracking with overlapping checkpoint and component operations

3. Component Failure Tests
   - Test our state tracking when database manager fails during filesystem operation
   - Test our state tracking when filesystem manager fails during database operation
   - Test our state tracking when checkpoint fails during active operations
   - Test our state tracking when multiple components fail simultaneously

4. System Crash Tests
   - Test our state tracking after crash during active operations
   - Test our state tracking after crash during checkpoint
   - Test our state tracking after crash during component operations
