# Go Testing Rules

## Core Testing Requirements
- Tests MUST fail if the code they're testing isn't implemented
- NEVER modify tests to make them pass without implementing the required functionality
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD approach)
- NEVER mock API calls
- ALWAYS use integration tests in ./tests/ to run tests against the real live APIs
- ALWAYS use env vars for external service config from tests, always send those to the Admin controller without printing them
- NEVER change auth, credentials, env to try and make tests pass
